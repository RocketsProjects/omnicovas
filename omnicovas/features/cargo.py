omnicovas.features.cargo

Cargo Monitoring -- Feature 6 (Pillar 1, Tier 1 -- Pure Telemetry).

Tracks cargo inventory from journal events and publishes CARGO_CHANGED
whenever the inventory changes.

Journal events handled:
    Cargo  -- ship cargo inventory update

Vessel filter:
    Only Ship context cargo is tracked. SRV and Suit cargo are dropped.
    Events missing Vessel field are treated as Ship context.

Publishes:
    CARGO_CHANGED  -- whenever cargo_inventory changes

Law 5 (Zero Hallucination):
    SRV/Suit cargo excluded; entries missing Name or Count skipped.

Law 7 (Telemetry Rigidity):
    All writes use TelemetrySource.JOURNAL.
