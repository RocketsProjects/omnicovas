Fuel & Jump Range -- Feature 5 (Pillar 1, Tier 1 -- Pure Telemetry).

Tracks fuel levels from journal events and fires threshold broadcasts when
fuel crosses below configured levels.

Journal events handled:
    FuelScoop      -- fuel gained from star scooping (incremental)
    RefuelAll      -- docked full refuel
    RefuelPartial  -- docked partial refuel
    StartJump      -- FSD jump initiated; fuel cost deducted

Threshold broadcasts (via ShipStateBroadcaster):
    FUEL_LOW      -- fuel drops below 25% of capacity (downward crossing only)
    FUEL_CRITICAL -- fuel drops below 10% of capacity (downward crossing only)

Status.json fuel updates:
    fuel_main and fuel_reservoir are also updated by handle_status() in
    handlers.py on every Status.json poll. This handler fires on journal
    events only. The two paths write to the same StateManager fields with
    different TelemetrySources (JOURNAL vs STATUS_JSON), so source priority
    is enforced automatically.

Jump range:
    jump_range_ly is populated from Loadout.MaxJumpRange by ship_state.py.
    This module does NOT recompute jump range from physics -- that is
    Pillar 3 (Exploration) work in Phase 5.

Law 5 (Zero Hallucination):
    Thresholds are only broadcast on downward crossings. A ship that starts
    a session at 15% fuel does not trigger FUEL_LOW -- it would have crossed
    the threshold before the session data is available to us.

Law 7 (Telemetry Rigidity):
    All updates declare TelemetrySource.JOURNAL.
